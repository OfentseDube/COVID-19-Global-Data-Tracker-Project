# COVID-19-Global-Data-Tracker-Project

Project Title and Short Description:

Title: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)    
Description: The project involves an exploratory data analysis of COVID-19 data. It includes visualizations and data cleaning to derive insights.    
Objectives of the Project:

Visualize and analyze COVID-19 data using various plots (bar plots, line plots, pie charts, heatmaps, and choropleth maps).    
Identify key trends and statistics related to COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations.    
Clean and preprocess the data for analysis.    
List of Tools and Libraries Used:

Python    
Pandas    
Matplotlib    
Seaborn    
Plotly    
Numpy    
Datetime    
How to Run/View the Project:

The project consists of Python scripts. To run the project, you would need to execute these scripts in a Python environment.
The visualizations generated by the scripts (like the choropleth map) are saved as HTML files, which can be viewed in a web browser.    
Insights or Reflections:

The analysis reveals trends in COVID-19 cases, deaths, and vaccinations across different countries and regions.    
The United States of America has the highest cumulative total of COVID-19 cases.    
There are substantial differences in cumulative case totals across different WHO regions.    
South Africa has a notable cumulative total of cases per 100,000 population, indicating a high proportion of its population has been affected.
